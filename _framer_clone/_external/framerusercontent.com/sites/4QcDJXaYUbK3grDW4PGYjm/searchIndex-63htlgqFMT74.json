The project explored transient nanoscale coatings designed to temporarily mask donor cell antigens while preserving stem-cell viability and engraftment potential. Through theoretical modeling and experimental design, the work establishes a scalable proof-of-concept for improving access to curative stem-cell therapies across diverse patient populations.","Machine Learning @ GMU","This study addressed gaps in predicting how metal ions, organic ligands, and environmental conditions jointly influence dissolution and adhesion in metal–organic systems. A unified dataset of 71 experimentally validated reactions was constructed using molecular properties of metals, high-dimensional descriptors of organic compounds, and environmental variables such as pH and temperature. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models were trained to predict outcomes and identify key molecular features driving reactivity, establishing an interpretable, data-driven framework applicable to sustainable chemistry and biomaterials engineering.","Energy Consumption in Deep Learning Models","This research examined how system-level and architectural factors affect energy consumption during CPU-based deep learning training. Using the BUTTER-E dataset with node-level watt-meter measurements, a multivariate regression model quantified the impact of power draw, runtime, model size, and depth on total energy use. The analysis showed that active compute time and instantaneous power dominate energy consumption, reinforcing sustainable AI principles and providing a practical forecasting tool for resource-constrained research environments.","Python","Java","C++","C","R","Competitive Programming","HTML/CSS/JavaScript","Data Analysis/Manipulation","Computational Modelling","Computer-Aided-Design","Computer Vision Pipelines","Artificial Intelligence","President's Award for Educational Excellence","President's Volunteer Service Award","National Honor Society","National Chinese Honor Society","Shawn at his first research conference, presenting his freshman year's yearlong research project.","Create a free website with Framer, the website builder loved by startups, designers and agencies."],"codeblock":[],"url":"/academics"},"/about":{"version":1,"title":"Luzia - Portfolio Template","description":"A sleek and modern portfolio website template designed for creatives to showcase their work with elegance and clarity.","keywords":"","h1":["Meet Shawn… a student builder interested in engineering, research, and design, focused on creating thoughtful, functional experiences that serve real people."],"h2":["I aim to make a real difference through the work I build and the communities I serve","Major works","Wanna know more about me?","see ya.© 2025 sh4wn.
